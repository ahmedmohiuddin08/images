    Did you notice? With the height and width changed or set to a fixed size, the quality of the images has fallen
    instantly. The images have been stretched because of the proportion was not exactly the same as the original images had.
    <br>
    If you want to give all the images a fixed width, without losing the quality and proportion then the best way would base
    putting the images inside separate divs. Set the divs height and width.
    <br>
    An alternative way could also be setting height and width of the images. And apply a CSS3 property called "object-fit" and
    and set its value to "cover". The images will not lose its quality and size.
